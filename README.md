# 🛝Sliding Window Techniques

## 📌 Introduction
Sliding Window is a commonly used technique to solve problems related to subarrays or substrings. Instead of recalculating results for every subarray, we **slide** a window across the data and update results accordingly. This technique greatly improves efficiency for problems involving contiguous segments.

## ✏️ Types of Sliding Window Problems
1. 🧩 **Fixed Size Sliding Window**: The window size remains constant throughout.
2. 🧪 **Variable Size Sliding Window**: The window size changes dynamically based on conditions.

## ⚡ Advantages of Sliding Window:
- **Optimized Time Complexity**: Reduces repetitive computations by processing overlapping elements only once.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Only a subset of the data is stored and processed at a time.
- **Dynamic Adaptability**: Especially useful when solving problems with variable conditions like finding maximum/minimum subarray lengths.


## 👀 Common Use Cases:
- **Constant Size Window**.
- **Longest Subarray or Substring with some Condition**.
- **Count Number of Subarrays with some Condition**.
- **Shortest or Minimum Window with some Condition**.
